# Mangatana 

An app to help you track those weird Japanese cartoons you're ashamed to tell your friends and family about.

```
Please note, this app is still in development and the upcoming updates will feature more content.
Also I'm planning on migrating this improvised task tracker to a proper trello board.
That being said, if you have any ideas on how to improve this project - I'm more than willing to listen.
